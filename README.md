# JavaScript
 This repository is for projects I completed while taking the JavaScript course at The Tech Academy.
 
 ## Projects
 - [Todo-app](https://github.com/PDXoreothekID/JavaScript/tree/main)
 - [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/PDXoreothekID/PDXoreothekID.github.io)


### todo-app
This app is an example of JavaScript in use. I use JS functions to add and remove items from the todo list.


### Portfolio Website
I have added some JavaScript to this website. The JavaScript adds a slideshow with 'next' and 'previous' buttons. There are also navigation dots at the bottom of the slideshow for the user to navigate through the slideshow.
